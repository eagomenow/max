You also understand and acknowledge that Clarity does not edit, modify, filter, screen, monitor, endorse or guarantee Member Content or the content of communications between Members.

You acknowledge and agree that, as an Expert, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions.
            </p>

          <h3>No Endorsement</h3>

          <p>
            As stated above, Clarity does not endorse any of its Members.

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>

          <h3>Appointments and Financial Terms</h3>

          <p>
            Appointments and Financial Terms for Experts:
            If you (as an Expert) have received an Appointment request from a Member, you will be required to either confirm or reject the request within 24 hours of when the request is made (as determined by Clarity in its sole discretion) or the request will be automatically cancelled. When an Appointment is requested with you via the Site, Application and Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Seeker who has requested the Appointment, and (ii) a link to the Seeker’s Clarity Account profile page, so that you can view this information before confirming or rejecting the Appointment. When you confirm an Appointment request, Clarity will send you an email, text message or message via the Application confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services.
            </p>
            <p>
            The amount due and payable by a Seeker relating to Appointment time with you is referred to as an <strong>“Appointment Fee”</strong>. Appointment Fees are quoted in each Listing, in U.S. dollars and in a price per minute format (the <strong>“Appointment Fee Rate”</strong>).  Please note that it is Experts, and not Clarity, which set all Appointment Fee Rates.
            </p>
            <p>
            In consideration of the Services, Clarity charges you a fee (the <strong>“Service Fee”</strong>) based on a percentage of Appointment Fees collected on your behalf. The current applicable percentage is fifteen percent (15%). The Service Fee is deducted from the Appointment Fee payable to you in respect of an Appointment. At the conclusion of each Appointment, Clarity calculates the appropriate Appointment Fee payable by the Seeker to you based on the duration of the Appointment and the applicable Appointment Fee Rate.  After deducting the applicable Service Fee, Clarity remits the balance of the Appointment Fee to you via its third party provider <a href="http://www.stripe.com/">www.stripe.com</a> or such other payment methods as may be listed on the Site or via the Application, in U.S. dollars. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.
            </p>
            <p>
            Please note that Clarity does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings. However, you acknowledge and agree that Clarity reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings. Please note that Clarity will provide notice of any Listing fee collection via the Site, Application and Services, in accordance with these Terms, prior to implementing such a Listing fee feature.
            </p>

            <p>

              Appointments and Financial Terms for Seekers
              </p>
              <p>
              You (as a Seeker), not Clarity, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed Appointments.  If you choose to enter into a transaction with an Expert by scheduling an Appointment via the Site or Application, these Terms and other terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Appointment as set out in the Listing may apply. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Clarity, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, and Clarity is not a party to such agreements and disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements.
              </p>
              <p>
              You agree to pay Clarity all Appointment Fees due in connection with any Appointment. In order to initiate an Appointment, you understand and agree that Clarity reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to obtain a pre-authorization of your credit card or charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one U.S. dollar ($1), in order to verify your credit card. At the end of each Appointment, Clarity will process and collect the Appointment Fees payable in accordance with these Terms and the terms of the Listing. Please note that Clarity cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Member by his or her bank related to Clarity’s collection of the Appointment Fees, and Clarity disclaims all liability in this regard.
              </p>
              <p>
              In connection with your payment, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Clarity or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay Clarity for any consummated Appointments in accordance with these Terms, by one of the methods described on the Site or Application – e.g. by <a href="http://www.stripe.com/">www.stripe.com</a>. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the Appointment, either directly by Clarity or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application.  If you are directed to Clarity’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed Appointment.
              </p>

          </p>

          <h3>Severability</h3>

          <p>These Terms are intended to govern the agreement between Clarity and you to the extent permitted by all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.  If any provision of these Terms or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall, for any reason or to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of these Terms and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby, but rather shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law.
          </p>

          <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>

          <p>
            You and Clarity agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site or Application (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration , except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Clarity are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Clarity otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</em> The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med">www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>Arbitration Process.</em> A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="http://www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3477">www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3477</a> and a separate form for California residents at <a href="http://www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3485">www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3485</a>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>Arbitration Location and Procedure.</em> Unless you and Clarity otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Clarity submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>Arbitrator’s Decision.</em> The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>Fees.</em> Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Clarity will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>Changes.</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if Clarity amends this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms) you will be notified in accordance with these Terms.

    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <hr>

      <p>Clarity is owned and operated by Fundable LLC (hereinafter collectively referred to as <strong>“Clarity”</strong>, <strong>“we”</strong> or <strong>“us”</strong>). Clarity takes your privacy very seriously.  We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of www.clarity.fm (the <strong>"Site"</strong>) and our application for mobile devices (the <strong>"Application"</strong>).
      Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service (<a href="http://www.clarity.fm/terms">www.clarity.fm/terms</a>).
      </p>
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>This Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time, applies only to information that you provide to us through the Site and Application. Please note that the Site and Application may contain links to other websites. If you click on a link to another website, this Privacy Policy will not apply to any information collected on that website. Clarity is not responsible for the privacy practices, security, or content of these other websites, and we recommend that you read the privacy policies of each website that you visit.
      </p>
      <p>
      As used in this policy, the terms <strong>"using"</strong> and <strong>"processing"</strong> information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.
      </p>

      <h3>The Collection of Information</h3>

      <p>Our principal goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, Application, services, features and content, to administer your use of the Site and Application (collectively, the <strong>"Service"</strong>) and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site and Application. The types of information that we collect include:
      </p>
      <p>
      Information you provide to us
      </p>
      <p>

      <em>Personal Information:</em> You may browse the Site and Application without providing any personal information that may be used to identify you personally.  However, when you register for and use the Service, access certain content or features, or directly contact the Site or Application, we may ask you to provide information, including:
      </p>
      <p>
        </p><ul>
          <li>your name, phone number, mobile phone number, email address and postal address;</li>
          <li>your username, password, and account setting preferences;</li>
          <li>your credit card number, billing address and other billing related information.</li>
        </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      (collectively, <strong>“Personal Information”</strong>)
      Information automatically collected
      When you visit and interact on the Site or Application, certain information is collected automatically, including:
      </p>
      <p>
      <em>Non-Identifying Information:</em>  We collect other non-identifying information you provide as part of the registration, administration and personalization of your Clarity Account profile (e.g. account preferences) (<strong>“Non-Identifying Information”</strong>). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Clarity Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Site, Application and Service and to analyze and understand how our Site, Application and Service are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.
       </p>
        <p>
      <em>Log Data:</em>  When you visit the Site and Application, whether as a Member or a non-registered user (any of these, a <strong>"Clarity User"</strong>), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (<strong>"Log Data"</strong>). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (<strong>"IP"</strong>) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site and Application, pages of our Site and Application that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site and Application, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site, Application and the Service and for the Site and Application’s technical administration, to increase our Site and Application’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Site and Application to our visitors’ needs. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.

      </p>
      <p>
      <em>Cookies:</em> Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site and Application. Second, we utilize session cookies to enable certain features of the Site and Application, to better understand how you interact with the Site and Application and to monitor aggregate usage by Clarity Users and web traffic routing on the Site and Application. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site or Application and then close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or Application or all functionality of the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
      <em>Web Beacons:</em> Our Site and Application may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our Site and Application are used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our Member communications and marketing campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p><ul>
        <li>(c) Information collected from other sources</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      We may access information about you from third-party sources and platforms.  You can register to use the Service by logging into online accounts you may have with third party service providers (<strong>"TPSP"</strong>)(e.g. Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn); each such account, a <strong>"Third Party Account"</strong>, via our Site or Application as described below. As part of the functionality of the Site, Service and Application, you may link your Clarity Account with Third Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third Party Account login information to Clarity through the Site, Service or Application; or (ii) allowing Clarity to access your Third Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third Party Account login information to Clarity and/or grant Clarity access to your Third Party Account for use for the purposes described herein without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Party Account and without obligating Clarity to pay any fees or making Clarity subject to any usage limitations imposed by the applicable TPSP.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you register by logging into a Third Party Account via our Site or Application, we will obtain the Personal Information you have provided to the applicable TPSP (such as your true name, email address, profile picture, names of TPSP friends, names of TPSP groups to which you belong, other information you make publicly available via the applicable TPSP and/or other information you authorize Clarity to access by authorizing the TPSP to provide such information) from your Third Party Accounts and use that information to create your Clarity Account and Clarity Account profile page. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third Party Accounts, you understand that by granting us access to the Third Party Accounts, we will access, make available and store (if applicable and as permitted by the TPSP and authorized by you) the information in your Third Party Accounts so that it is available on and through your Clarity Account on the Site, Service and Application. If there is information about your "friends" or people with whom you are associated in your Third Party Account, the information we obtain about those "friends" or people with whom you are associated, may also depend on the privacy settings such people have with the applicable TPSP.

      </p>

      <h3>Security and Data Retention</h3>

      <p>
      To protect your privacy and information, Clarity uses multiple security procedures and practices to protect from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification and disclosure of Personal Information of users.
      </p>
      <p>
      When you enter Personal Information on our Site and Application, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL creates a secured connection between our web servers and your browser, which protects against unauthorized access to transmitted data and supports data being sent only to intended recipients.
      </p>
      <p>
      Your Personal Information is password protected and our main servers are locked and hosted by a leading provider of Internet access to enterprises with mission-critical Internet application requirements. Access to the host environment is secure.
      </p>
      <p>
      Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Clarity. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your Clarity Account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited email or telephone communication.
      </p>
      <p>
      We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Site and Application, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@clarity.fm">support@clarity.fm</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Note that we will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Site and Application in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sharing personal email addresses, phone numbers, Skype/IM usernames or any other personal contact details.
      </p>

      <p>
        All communications, information and files exchanged should be performed exclusively using Clarity’s messaging system. The main reason this it is required is to keep communications and transactions on Clarity is for your safety. The internet industry has traditionally been inundated with risk and uncertainty. Clarity is a new form of communications. For this community to thrive, security and trust must be maintained for all users. This is only possible through maintaining initial conversations within the Clarity application. Protecting our users’ privacy is of critical concern for everyone on the Clarity team. To protect our users’ privacy, personal information should be kept anonymous. Requesting or providing email addresses, skype/IM usernames or other personal contact details (other than your name) are strictly prohibited. Clarity’s Call Back service and User Inboxes are designed to enable communication between all users.
      </p>

      I'm starting my own PR company. You worked in the industry for several years and I want your take on what the risk/reward would be considering my market's constraints and opportunities.

    <h5>1. Search for experts</h5>
    <p>We have high standards. Search through our extensive lineup of professionals in just about any given field who are itching to make your problems a thing of the past. We have experts who can help you with anything from design and copywriting all the way up to structuring deals or raising funding. You can search by expertise, industry and job title.
    </p>

    <h5>2. Schedule a call</h5>
    <p>Pick a date and time that works best for you (you’ll have 3 options). You’ll see the per minute rate right up front, so you can determine how long you’d like to talk. Submit your request, and within 48 hours, you’ll be receiving a confirmation. Experts are evaluated by how promptly they respond, so you should hear back soon after you submit your request.
    </p>

    <h5>3. Get your problem solved</h5>
    <p>Ever try emailing someone for advice? You ask five questions and you get a reply which barely answers one. Then the email thread continues for another week only to lead to more confusion. There’s nothing like getting on the phone and getting your questions answered right now.  Sometimes it’s solved before time runs out on the call, and you can bring up other things you might want to talk about. Getting to the bottom of whatever issue you’re dealing with, over the phone, with a helpful professional is a huge relief and is a great experience for both sides of the conversation.
